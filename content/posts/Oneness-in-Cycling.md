## Experience with Cycling

Cycling usually comprises fatigue, sweat and cardiovascular exercise. It can get demanding quickly as we are burning huge amounts of calories in a matter of minutes. For context, playing basketball with moderate running would burn around 180-250 kcal per hour. Walking around the park would burn 160 kcal per hour. Cycling can burn anywhere from 1000 kcal per hour to 1700 kcal per hour. All these numbers are rough estimates based on my Garmin Enduro 3 recording these activities tracking my heart rate, except for 1700 kcal per hour for cycling. This number comes from cycling races pro teams take part in, and this limit is for them. I never achieved that sort of calorie burn.

When climbing mountains with a bicycle, our life choices become questionable. It has suffering and hardship in abundance. However, there are moments - and these can last for hours sometimes - when we don’t feel the fatigue or the lactate buildup in our muscles. We don’t feel different regarding our bike, or merely an extension of our body. We feel like it is both part of and one with us. We feel in harmony with the bike. Commonly, riding at high velocities causes a substantial reduction in vibrations, making the ride feel like floating.

**Quick Sidenote:** An outstanding example of reduced vibration on the bicycle is Mathieu van der Poel riding on cobbles at 50 km/hr in many editions of Paris-Roubaix. This prestigious road bike race is held every year in the northern part of France, and winning there is equivalent to winning a gold medal at the Olympics. The route is also known as the "Hell of the North," a nickname it earned because of its grueling conditions, including treacherous cobblestone sections that test the endurance and skill of even the most seasoned cyclists. The race is unforgiving, highly fatiguing, and demands incredible physical and mental resilience. Mathieu van der Poel's ability to navigate these challenging conditions at high speeds is a testament to his exceptional talent and determination, inspiring cyclists worldwide to push their limits and strive for greatness. He looks like he is floating in the air, unaffected by cobblestones. [Here is an example](https://youtu.be/Zt981h3zlwk?t=404) of the same.

This oneness with the bike is an amazing feeling. You observe the surrounding scenery; you make good memories; you forget all the troubles you are facing in life. I would say it is rather meditative and relaxing, and that it restores mental peace. Chasing after therefore many people ride bikes for hours and call it fun. For an outsider, it sounds insane; which is probably why it works so well.

## Nullness and Oneness - Eastern Philosophical Concept

### Nullness (Shunyavada)

Shunyavada, or the doctrine of emptiness, is a concept found in Mahayana Buddhism. It posits that all phenomena are empty of intrinsic existence or essence. This teaching suggests that everything in the universe is interconnected and interdependent, lacking inherent self-nature. The term "shunya" translates to "zero" or "void," implying a state of nothingness or emptiness. This does not mean that things do not exist, but rather that they exist in a state of constant flux and interdependence, devoid of any permanent, unchanging essence.

### Oneness (Mayavada)

Mayavada is a concept found in Advaita Vedanta, a school of Hindu philosophy. It teaches the idea of non-dualism, where the ultimate reality, Brahman, is the only true existence, and everything else is an illusion (Maya). According to Mayavada, the world we perceive is not ultimately real but is rather a projection or illusion created by our minds. The goal of spiritual practice is to realize the true nature of reality as Brahman, the ultimate oneness.

## Oneness in Action: In Other Areas

In Robert Jordan’s The Wheel of Time series, "being one with the sword" is a compelling depiction of the fusion of mind, body, and weapon, achieved through the practice of "The Void." This state of mental clarity, where warriors clear their minds of distractions and emotions, enables them to perform with heightened awareness and precision. The concept resonates with Zen Buddhism’s "Mushin" and the Bushido code, emphasizing the importance of mental discipline and focus in martial arts. Characters like Lan Mandragoran and Rand al'Thor exemplify this state in key battles, demonstrating how mental discipline is crucial for martial mastery.

The series vividly portrays this concept through characters who enter the Void to achieve extraordinary combat skills. For instance, Lan Mandragoran’s battles showcase a deep connection between warrior and weapon, while Rand al'Thor’s experiences with the "Flame and the Void" highlight the need for mental clarity in combat. These depictions mirror real-world martial arts practices, where achieving a flow state is essential for peak performance. The sword in The Wheel of Time is not merely a tool but a symbol of heritage and identity, adding depth to the narrative by illustrating how weapons become extensions of the warrior’s will and spirit.

The broader themes of destiny, identity, and the struggle against darkness further emphasize the significance of "being one with the sword." These themes align with real-world philosophies that stress mental discipline and focus as pathways to mastery. By exploring these ideas, The Wheel of Time offers readers a profound look into martial arts as both a physical and spiritual discipline, bridging the gap between fantasy and reality. The series’ portrayal of this concept underscores its timeless relevance, highlighting how mental clarity and unity with one’s tools can lead to extraordinary achievements.

Investing hundreds of hours in The Wheel of Time series immerses readers in a vast, intricate world with complex characters and intertwining storylines, offering a deep exploration of themes like destiny and identity. In contrast, a movie like **The Last Samurai** encapsulates similar themes in just a few hours, providing a streamlined and accessible narrative. While the series delves deeply into character development and layered thematic exploration, the movie format condenses these ideas into a concise, impactful glimpse. Each format has its strengths—one offering depth and immersion, the other providing a quick yet poignant experience of parallel ideas.

## Conclusion

I have shared similar ideas in my other article [here](https://ashwinbalaji.xyz/posts/murakamis-running-book/), but the parallel there is running. I believe this to be true for any type of endurance sport.
