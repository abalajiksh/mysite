I am Ashwin Balaji. My primary interests are:
1. The concept of time in Physics - especially in Quantum Gravity
1. Structure, Geometry and Quantization of Gauge Theories
1. Philosophy of Physics - Hans Reichenbach is a personal favourite of mine.

## TL;DR
I am studying Masters inb Physics at Ruprecht Karl Universitt Heidelberg. I am crazy about theoretical physics, electronics, mathematics and computations. Some of my hobbies can be checked out in the following links.

I am a Master's student at [Heidelberg University](https://www.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/?lang=en) and earned my Bachelor's (BTech) at National Institute of Technology, Calicut ([NITC](https://depcent.nitc.ac.in/physics/)). I worked on 2 theses titled "Introduction to Lattice Gauge Theory with Wilson Loops" and "Coherent State Path Integral Formalism for Fermions in Quantum Mechanics" under my esteemed supervisor [Dr. Sreeraj](https://nitc.ac.in/department/physics/faculty-and-staff/faculty/3a45fbe4-3831-4589-bfdc-27d07d5dfa49).

My primary source of inspiration for pursuing physics is Lev Davidovich Landau (Russian: Лев Дави́дович Ланда́у). His books and other Russian texts enhanced my passion for Physics.

This site is primarily filled with my rantings over some topics but hopefully can bring out some useful ideas that could help with an understanding of concepts a little easier. It also includes a lot of thought processes I go through every day and record them here. I am passionate about Theoretical Physics, however; I am also interested in some basic Electronics, CAD designs, and a lot of Computations.

I like to think of myself as a Gardener. I tend to my thoughts often and nurture them to grow into something useful. That happens to be "a" reason why this is the 4th iteration of this site. You can visit the 3rd iteration [here](https://website-5m1.pages.dev/). The 2nd iteration was based on Ghost and the 1st on Wordpress: meaning they were hosted on a private server that is taken down now. Some of those old articles survived and made it to here. 

Other than all these I love to sink myself in books: SciFi, Fantasy or Non-fiction. Foundation by Asimov is one of my favourites, so is Dune by Frank Herbert. I do enjoy poetry, my favourite being "Forever-is composed of nows" by Emily Dickinson. I also do a lot of Road Cycling and Mountain Biking, with former being the major part of it. You can check me out on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/ashwinbalaji) and/or [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/ashwinbalaji) to see what I am up to. If I am riding my bicycle, you can most probably track me live [here](https://live.garmin.com/ashwinbalaji).

I do love well written movies, with good audio engineering. Well who doesn't love movies? If you wanna know another piece of me(get the reference?, if not ask me!), you may do so [here](https://letterboxd.com/abksh1011/).

All of this sounds like me chasing after irrelevant things or just trying out new stuff for fun. However, I like to think of all of this just like a fantasy novel rather than a single romance novel. There are world building, complex character arcs, sub-stories, magic system, lore and a lot more excruciating details that make a lots of people think, "when will this get to a point?". All of those will tie up and come together nicely in the end of the fantasy series. It is a lot of work, but the reward is out of bounds: for the lack of better phrasing. I would like to think the same about these "distractions" to come together one day.

You can indulge in my distractions by following the articles or other social media sites I have linked here, and if you feel like it, leave a comment, or just say hi. You can contact me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ashwinbalaji00/), but like most people, if I don't reply, ping me again.
