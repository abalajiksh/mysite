I am Ashwin Balaji. My primary interests are:
1. The concept of time in Physics - especially in Quantum Gravity
1. Structure and Quantization of Gauge Theories
1. Philosophy of Physics - Hans Reichenbach is a personal favourite of mine.

I am a Master's student at [Heidelberg University](https://www.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/?lang=en) and earned my Bachelor's (BTech) at National Institute of Technology, Calicut ([NITC](https://depcent.nitc.ac.in/physics/)). I worked on 2 theses titled "Introduction to Lattice Gauge Theory with Wilson Loops" and "Coherent State Path Integral Formalism for Fermions in Quantum Mechanics" under my esteemed supervisor [Dr. Sreeraj](https://nitc.ac.in/department/physics/faculty-and-staff/faculty/3a45fbe4-3831-4589-bfdc-27d07d5dfa49).

but hopefully can bring out some useful ideas that could help with understanding of concepts a little more easier. It also includes a lot of thought processes that I go through everyday and record them here. I am passionate about Theoretical Physics, however, I am also interested in some basic Electronics, CAD designs, and a lot of Computations.

Other than all these I love to sink myself in books, SciFi, Fantasy or Non-fiction. I also do a lot of Road Cycling and mountain Biking, with former being the major part of it. You can check me out on Goodreads and/or Strava to see what I am upto.

You can contact me on Instagram, but like most people if I dont reply, don't hesitate to ping me back.
