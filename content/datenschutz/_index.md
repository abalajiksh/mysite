## TLDR

This site uses a little vanilla JavaScript, a dash of CSS, and the power of Hugo. It is just a bunch of HTML pages with no annoying pop-ups or site-wide tracking. It’s also **tiny** and **privacy conscious**. No JavaScript frameworks, icon packs, or Google fonts. No ads or trackers polluting your console window.

Readers are offered the choice to read in light or dark mode. The user’s preference is remembered and saved in local storage. Dark mode is the default for first time visitors.

The pages are served from CloudFlare Pages service, so Cloudflare will get some basic analytics like the time and URL opened, geolocation and other basic information your browser attaches to it's `GET` request.
